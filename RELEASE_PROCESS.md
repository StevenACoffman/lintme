# Release Process

Releases are published to GitHub using [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com). The configuration lives in [`.goreleaser.yaml`](.goreleaser.yaml).

## What GoReleaser does

- Runs `go mod tidy` and `go generate ./...` before building
- Builds binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows on `amd64` and `arm64`
- Packages binaries as `.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows)
- Generates a changelog from commits since the previous tag (excluding `docs:` and `test:` prefixes)
- Creates a GitHub release and uploads all artifacts

## Prerequisites

- [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) installed
- A GitHub personal access token with the `repo` scope, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is used by GoReleaser to publish the GitHub release. `gowheels pypi` reads its own `GOWHEELS_GITHUB_TOKEN` env var to download release assets without hitting API rate limits — these are separate variables.

## Steps

### 1. Tag the release

```sh
git tag -a v0.6.0 -m "Release v0.6.0"
git push origin v0.6.0
```

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

### 2. Run GoReleaser

```sh
goreleaser release --clean
```

`--clean` removes the `dist/` directory before building to ensure a fresh output.

## Testing a release locally

Build and package artifacts without publishing to GitHub:

```sh
goreleaser release --clean --skip=publish
```

Or build a snapshot (no tag required):

```sh
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/`.

## Useful flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--clean` | Delete `dist/` before building |
| `--skip=publish` | Build and package but do not publish to GitHub |
| `--skip=validate` | Skip dirty-tree and tag checks |
| `--snapshot` | Build without a tag; implies `--skip=publish` |
| `--draft` | Create a draft GitHub release instead of publishing |

## Publishing Python wheels to PyPI

After a GitHub release exists, the pre-built binaries attached to it can be repackaged as Python wheels and published to PyPI using gowheels.

### Install gowheels

```sh
go install github.com/StevenACoffman/gowheels@latest
```

### Build wheels locally (no upload)

```sh
gowheels pypi --package-name lintmego --name lintme --repo StevenACoffman/lintme
```

Wheels are written to `./dist/`. Inspect them before uploading.

### Build and upload to PyPI in one step

```sh
export GOWHEELS_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>    # read as --github-token; avoids GitHub API rate limits
export GOWHEELS_PYPI_TOKEN=<your-pypi-token> # read as --pypi-token; authenticates the upload

gowheels pypi --name lintme --package-name lintmego --repo StevenACoffman/lintme --upload
```

`GOWHEELS_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GOWHEELS_PYPI_TOKEN` are read automatically from the environment — no `--github-token` or `--pypi-token` flags are needed when they are set. `gowheels pypi` fetches the release assets from GitHub, extracts the binary from each archive, wraps it in a platform-specific wheel, and uploads each wheel to PyPI.

To target a specific release tag rather than the latest:

```sh
gowheels pypi --name lintme --package-name lintmego --repo StevenACoffman/lintme --version v0.6.0 --upload
```

## Appendix: Automated PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/postrelease.yaml` runs automatically whenever a GitHub release is published. It uses `gowheels pypi --upload` to build the wheels and publish them to PyPI via OIDC in a single step — no `GOWHEELS_PYPI_TOKEN` secret is required.

### One-time setup: PyPI trusted publishing

1. **Create a PyPI account** at <https://pypi.org> if you do not already have one.

2. **Register the project** by publishing the first release manually (see the `gowheels pypi` steps above), or by creating the project name on PyPI before the first automated run.

3. **Add a trusted publisher** on PyPI:
   - Go to your project page on PyPI → **Manage** → **Publishing**.
   - Under *Add a new publisher*, choose **GitHub Actions**.
   - Fill in the fields:

     | Field | Value |
     |---|---|
     | Owner | `StevenACoffman` |
     | Repository name | `lintme` |
     | Workflow name | `postrelease.yaml` |
     | Environment name | `pypi` |

   - Click **Add**.

4. **Create the `pypi` environment** in the GitHub repository:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub → **Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment**.
   - Name it `pypi`.
   - Optionally add a required reviewer or deployment branch rule (e.g., restrict to tags matching `v*`) for additional protection.

Once both sides are configured, pushing a new tag and running the **Build and Publish** workflow (which creates the GitHub release) will automatically trigger `postrelease.yaml`, build the wheels, and publish them to PyPI without any secrets.
